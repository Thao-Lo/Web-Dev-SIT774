                <p class="section-text"><strong>Mint (Mentha spicata)</strong> is a fragrant, low-growing herb that
                    spreads easily and is simple to cultivate. In fact, it can grow so vigorously that it may take over
                    garden areas—so it's best to
                    keep mintconfined to its own pot, garden bed, or container.</p>
                <p class="section-text">Mint thrives in spots ranging from full sun to partial shade, provided the soil
                    stays moist. The sunnier the location, the more water your mint will need. It doesn't tolerate
                    extended dry periods,
                    so ensure it's in a place where it can be watered regularly, especially during hot, dry months.</p>
                <p class="section-text">There are many types of mint to choose from, including garden mint, spearmint,
                    peppermint, chocolate
                    mint, apple mint, and basil mint—each offering distinct flavours and aromas matching their names.

                            <li>Mint can be propagated easily from seeds, stem cuttings, or starter plants</li>
                            <li>To prevent it from spreading uncontrollably, grow mint in a dedicated pot, bed, or
                                planter </li>

                            <li>In colder climates, mint may die back in winter—cut it to the ground and apply a layer
                                of Scotts Osmocote; it will regrow as temperatures rise</li>

                </div>
                <p class="section-text">When planting mint directly in your garden, choose a contained area or a
                    separate garden bed, as mint spreads rapidly and can crowd out other plants.</p>
                <p class="section-text">To plant, take the mint out of its nursery pot and place it in the middle of a
                    prepared hole in the soil. If the roots are tightly packed, gently loosen them before planting.
                    Water the plant thoroughly after planting, and apply mulch around it to help keep the soil moist and
                    to reduce weed growth.</p>
                <p class="section-text">Allow the mint to settle and grow new shoots before you begin harvesting. You
                    can snip the leaves with sharp scissors whenever needed. The young tips are especially soft and
                    flavourful, but all\ leaves are usable.</p>
                <p class="section-text">To dry the leaves, use a dehydrator or hang bunches upside down in a dry, airy
                    location until they become crisp. Store the dried leaves in an airtight container for later use.</p>

                            Fill seed trays or small pots with Scotts Osmocote® Seed & Cutting Mix, scatter the seeds on
                            the surface, and cover them with a 1cm layer of potting mix.</p>
                        <p class="section-text">Keep the mix damp—but not soaked—while waiting for the seeds to sprout,
                            which usually takes 10 to 14 days.</p>
                        <p class="section-text">Once the seedlings reach about 10cm in height, move them to their final
